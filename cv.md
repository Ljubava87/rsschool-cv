## Summary
With a burning desire to learn and grow, I am ready to take on new challenges at RS School. My background in media, design, and IT training allows me to be a versatile professional. I have successfully worked for a socio-political publication as a photojournalist, correspondent and typesetter. Promoting science and creating press releases, I was active in the press office of the world's leading aviation science center. I also did graphic and web design and created media support for music festivals. My latest achievement is the completion of the "Software Testing" course at the world's leading IT company First Line Software. I am ready to use my experience and knowledge to actively participate in the RS School projects and to continue developing in the IT sphere.
